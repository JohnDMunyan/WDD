        Welcome to my portfolio website! Here you can find links to my cover letter and resume for review. Yes, I am an Automotive Engineering Techology graduate from BYU-Idaho, but that hasn’t stopped my curiosity for computer programming. In this website you will be able to see my past work and internships that I’ve completed and learned from along with the skills that I learned from those experiences and how I use them. I hope that there is everything needed to learn a little about me and to help make a decision on any future corporation that we might have. This website will need to be changed to look professional for future use and if I can accurately have the website look professional on all different situations then that would be good.

      <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
      <p>
        The cover letter will have to be changed for each job application unless I create a different page for each job application I do and just remove it after I’ve been notified that I’m no longer considered for that position. I will be applying for most positions in Engineering so the projects that I’ll have either on this page or the next won’t have to change much and can be left after they have been finished, but I might just create a separate website for each one and customize it for that application use.

Hiring Manager
Westinghouse Electric Company
New Stanton, PA
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my interest in the Engineer I – Mechanical position (Requisition Number: 25290) at Westinghouse Electric Company. With a strong academic foundation in mechanical engineering and hands-on experience in engineering analysis and technical communication, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of delivering clean and safe energy solutions.
I recently graduated with a B.S. in Automotive Engineering Technology, maintaining a GPA above 3.0, and have experience working on projects involving mechanical testing and data analysis. During my academic career and internship experience, I developed skills in interpreting technical drawings and calculations, designing test plans, and authoring comprehensive technical reports—skills that align closely with the day-to-day responsibilities of this role. My coursework and lab work have provided me with a firm grounding in engineering mechanics, materials behavior, and system dynamics, which I believe will be invaluable in supporting your seismic and environmental qualification testing initiatives.
What attracts me most to Westinghouse is its longstanding leadership in the nuclear energy industry and its strong commitment to safety, innovation, and team accountability. I am especially drawn to the opportunity to work within the Qualification Operations Team, where I can contribute to projects that have meaningful, real-world safety impacts. My technical aptitude, attention to detail, and ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams will allow me to make immediate contributions and grow within your organization.
I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can support Westinghouse’s objectives and continue to develop professionally within your engineering team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
John Munyan

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        This last page will have all my past work and project experiences that I’ve had during my college experience. Each work experience will have some images from it and, if I have images for them then they will be added. My experiences might vary from others, but I can guarantee that they aren’t any less than that of other applications that are also looking for this position. I’m certain that the projects will be on this page with the potential change from this to the other page to not have repeating information that is not needed.
